# UDACITY-CAPSTONE-PROJECT


# INTRODUCTION
This repository provides a step by step analysis and forecasting model of aggregated data of retail store sales data.

Within the provided notebook we will first prepare the data so that they can be used by any forecasting model. We will then evaluate the performance of different forecasting models, starting with classic statistical SARIMA models up to Linear Regression and tree based models. For data processing, training and testing of the models a complete Time_Series_Model class will be provided which allows to qickly evaluate any specific model for time series.
